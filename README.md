# DRC
Digital Reserve Currency (ERC20 Token)
Digital Reserve Currency was designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply and zero inflation rate. 
DRC token was created during the COVID-19 crisis when fiscal and monetary policies have exposed serious vulnerabilities in the current financial system. 
100% of the DRC token supply has been listed on Uniswap decentralized exchange with intentionally small market cap to allow early adopters to establish inexpensive exposure to DRC if they believe it will have a larger market in the future. 
The token is fully developed and operational and its holders are immediately able to use it for its intended functionality on Ethereum blockchain. 
No one has managerial control over DRC or provides essential managerial efforts that affect its success as DRC has fully decentralized structure.
