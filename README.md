# DRC
Digital Reserve Currency (ERC-20 Token) was designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply and zero inflation rate. 
It was created during the COVID-19 crisis when fiscal and monetary policies have exposed serious vulnerabilities in the current financial system. 
100% of the DRC token supply has been listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange with intentionally small market cap to allow early adopters to establish inexpensive exposure to DRC if they believe it will have a larger market in the future. 
The DRC token is fully developed and operational and has a unique utility of providing exclusive access to the Digital Reserve, an online platform within the DRC ecosystem.  
No one has control over DRC or provides essential managerial efforts that affect its success as DRC has fully decentralized structure.
